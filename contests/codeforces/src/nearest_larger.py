# Nearest Larger
#
# Write a method, nearest_larger(arr, i) which takes an array and an index.
# The method should return another index,
# j: this should satisfy: (a) arr[i] < arr[j], AND
# (b) there is no j2 closer to i than j where arr[i] < arr[j2]. In
# case of ties (see example below), choose the earliest (left-most) of the two indices. If no number in arr is larger
#  than arr[i], return nil
